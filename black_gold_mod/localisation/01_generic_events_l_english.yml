 waldensian.1.d:0 "The Waldensians are a Protestant precursor movement founded by Peter Waldo in the late 12th century. Initially the Catholic Church only took issue to Waldo and his followers' not having a formal Church license for proselytizing. As time went on the rift between Waldensians and the Catholic Church grew greater until hostilities emerged that would last for centuries. Later, though, the Waldensians were mostly (though not entirely) absorbed into Protestant denominations. They were mostly secretive on the basis of religious persecution."

These convinced Waldo to live a devoted Christian life, of which he sold most of his belongings and preached his own religious interpretations."

Church property has been appropriated for the use of our new denomination."
