 mil_tech_cs_32_name:0 "Field Howitzer"
 mil_tech_cs_32_desc:0 "A howitzer is a type of artillery piece characterized by a relatively short barrel and the use of comparatively small propellant charges to propel projectiles over relatively high trajectories, with a steep angle of descent."
 mil_tech_cs_33_name:0 "Percussion-cap Weapons"
 mil_tech_cs_33_desc:0 "The percussion cap, introduced circa 1820, is a type of single-use ignition device used on muzzleloader firearms that enabled them to fire reliably in any weather conditions. This crucial invention gave rise to the caplock or percussion lock system."
 mil_tech_cs_34_name:0 "Mass Industrialization of Military Equipment"
 mil_tech_cs_34_desc:0 "Although military equipment has for a while been produced by factories around this time sees the regulation, standardization and proliferation of mass-production for military equipment. Guns, artillery pieces and other military hardware now can be produced en masse."
 mil_tech_cs_35_name:0 "Breech Loading Weapons"
 mil_tech_cs_35_desc:0 "Breech loading weapons have been in existence since the 14th century, but haven't been popular until recently. Breech loading weapons load their ammunition into a chamber from a latch or hatch behind the chamber, unlike muzzle loading weapons which insert a projectile from the frontal bore."
 mil_tech_cs_36_name:0 "Bolt-Action Rifles"
 mil_tech_cs_36_desc:0 "Bolt action is a type of firearm action where the handling of cartridges into and out of the weapon's barrel chamber is operated by manually manipulating the bolt directly via a handle."

 mil_tech_cs_38_name:0 "Armored Vehicles"
 mil_tech_cs_38_desc:0 "Armored Vehicles are any kind of vehicle - most notably tanks - using metallic armor plating of various types. Tankettes and Armored Cars are other types of armored vehicles, some of which barely preceded the conception of the Battle Tank in World War One."
 mil_tech_cs_39_name:0 "Trench Fortifications"
 mil_tech_cs_39_desc:0 "Trenches are most famously used during World War One as a reaction to the increasing firepower of modern arms, such as machine guns. Trench Warfare itself was in a strategic sense exceptionally slow, at least to change the dynamics on the frontline. It was broken when it was discovered that Battle Tanks could bypass the trenches themselves and eliminate any defenders."
 mil_tech_cs_40_name:0 "Inter-War Air Forces"
 mil_tech_cs_40_desc:0 "Although planes have existed since the 1900s (before 1910) as an advent of the Wright Brothers' design, they were limited to mostly a passive role as a scout vehicle. This did not stop fighter planes during World War One (most notably the Red Baron, a German pilot) from being used to shoot down enemy scouts. Also, light strategic bombers did exist as far back as the 1910s."
 mil_tech_cs_41_name:0 "Early Modern Tanks"
 mil_tech_cs_41_desc:0 "The modern conception of tanks generally includes a 360 degree rotating top-mounted turret affixed with a main cannon of at least 20mm or higher, sometimes with a coaxial machine gun mount next to it. This was not always the case with Battle Tank technology as some tanks during World War One had several turrets on the sides (see Mark tank series enumerated I-X) but some light tanks from that era had a somewhat modern design philosophy."
 mil_tech_cs_42_name:0 "Submachine Gun"
 mil_tech_cs_42_desc:0 "Submachine guns were at the time a lightweight full-automatic weapon system, the most mobile of handheld infantry weapons. Though they were in part superseded by Personal Defense Weapons and Automatic Rifles during the later stages of World War Two and beyond, they still hold their own to this day as a useful weapon of choice for various applications."
 mil_tech_cs_43_name:0 "Nuclear Weapons Research"
 mil_tech_cs_43_desc:0 "Nuclear weapons have been hypothesized even before and during World War I. H.G. Wells was interested in it and wrote "The World Set Free" in 1913. It featured atomic weapons, but even earlier than that (the late 19th century) it was proven that uranium could release large amounts of radioactive energy."
 mil_tech_cs_44_name:0 "Proliferation of Jet-plane technology"
 mil_tech_cs_44_desc:0 "Jet planes have been around since late World War II. Turbojets (the most common type of jet engine) were invented prior to it but the war caused innovations to it for military applications. Now we are seeing the development of jet engine technology and its usage in air forces, which is most likely here to stay."
 mil_tech_cs_45_name:0 "Kevlar"
 mil_tech_cs_45_desc:0 "Kevlar (invented by Stephanie Kwolek) is a heat resistant and also strong synthetic fiber. It has been used most famously by militaries as a form of body armor but has civilian uses."
 mil_tech_cs_46_name:0 "Ballistic Missile Guidance"
 mil_tech_cs_46_desc:0 "Ballistic Missiles are long-range missiles normally used to carry nuclear warheads. They have also been used by space agencies to carry probes, astronauts and equipment to other planets and their moons."
 mil_tech_cs_47_name:0 "Electronic Warfare"
 mil_tech_cs_47_desc:0 "Electronic Warfare is the discipline of using electronic devices, both hardware and software, to undermine efforts by our enemies. They can be used both during peacetime and during war for disinformation practices."
 mil_tech_cs_48_name:0 "Laser-Based Missile Defense"
 mil_tech_cs_48_desc:0 "Although lasers have been commonly considered in science fiction as direct-fire weapons for use against both armored and unarmored targets, the issue present with it is that so far the power sources for lasers strong enough to do that do not currently exist. They can, however, be more practically used to shoot down missiles of varying degrees."
 
 dip_tech_cs_32_name:0 "The Gold Standard"
 dip_tech_cs_32_desc:0 "Fiat currency existed in some form as a medium of exchange for centuries but translating it into gold (adoption of the Gold Standard) wasn't done much until the 1800's as the United Kingdom was the first to implement a system, followed by many other western powers."
 dip_tech_cs_33_name:0 "Steel Can"
 dip_tech_cs_33_desc:0 "A steel can is a container for the distribution or storage of goods, made of thin metal. Many cans require opening by cutting the "end" open; others have removable covers. They can store a broad variety of contents: food, beverages, oil, chemicals, etc. Steel cans are made of tinplate (tin-coated steel) or of tin-free steel. In some dialects, even aluminium cans are called "tin cans"."
 dip_tech_cs_34_name:0 "Steam Engines for Ships"
 dip_tech_cs_34_desc:0 "Steam Engines are a new method of propulsion for seafaring vessels. They do not require a large amount of operators as raft-propelled ships do, and they do not rely solely on the wind to guide the ship along. Truly, a revolutionary invention."
 dip_tech_cs_35_name:0 "The Ironclad"
 dip_tech_cs_35_desc:0 "Ironclads were the first iron hulled vessels in naval history. Because of this they were much sturdier than their counterparts and quickly became the standard for ship-of-the-line models, beginning in Britain."
 dip_tech_cs_36_name:0 "Oil Extraction"
 dip_tech_cs_36_desc:0 "Oil extraction is a process by which oil reserves are located through seismic measurement and excavated. Following the seismic analysis, a drill is used to access the oil reserves, through which it can be harvested."

 dip_tech_cs_42_name:0 "Diplomatic Globalization"
 dip_tech_cs_42_desc:0 "Though the world has seen globalization for several centuries by now, nations did not always consider others from other corners of the world as equals. As the West moved toward more liberal values, things such as decolonization and the Cold War made this necessary."
 dip_tech_cs_43_name:0 "Early Plastics"
 dip_tech_cs_43_desc:0 "Plastics are synthetic materials used in many commercial products around the world today, though clearly this wasn't always the case. Plastics became more frequent sights in the mid-late 20th century after new, popular forms of plastic were invented."

 dip_tech_cs_45_name:0 "Missile Ships"
 dip_tech_cs_45_desc:0 "Missile ships use missiles as an important armament of choice as missile guidance systems became more developed. With this increased the maximum effective range and accuracy of the ships themselves and allowed for more complicated attack patterns than their older brethren of the Battleship."
 dip_tech_cs_46_name:0 "Commercialized Computers"
 dip_tech_cs_46_desc:0 "Computing technology has existed for most of the 20th century already but developments and high prospects of the technology of information sharing have us conclude that furthering the betterment of this technological choice should be our top priority. Information dissemination and control are vital for all regimes, democratic or not."
